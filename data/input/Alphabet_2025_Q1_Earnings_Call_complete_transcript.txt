Welcome, everyone. Thank you for standing by for the Alphabet first quarter 2025 earnings conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker presentation, there will be a question and answer session. To ask a question during the session, you will need to press star 1 on your telephone. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Jim Friedland, senior director of investor relations.

Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Alphabet's first quarter 2025 earnings conference call. With us today are Sundar Pichai, Philip Schindler, and Anat Ashkenazi. Now, I'll quickly cover the safe harbor.

Statements that we make today regarding our business, operations and financial performance may be considered forward-looking. Such statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially.

Google's network is robust and resilient, supported by over 2 million miles of fiber and 33 subsea cables. Complementing this, we offer the industry's widest range of TPUs and GPUs and continue to invest in next-generation capabilities. Ironwood, our seventh-generation TPU and most powerful to date, is the first designed specifically for inference at scale.

2.5 Pro achieved big leaps in reasoning, coding, science, and math.

Turning to open models, we launched Gemma 3 last month, delivering state-of-the-art performance for its size. Gemma models have been downloaded more than 140 million times. Lastly, we are developing AI models

where there's enormous opportunity. For example, our new Gemini robotics models. And in health, we launched AI co-scientist, a multi-agent AI research system, while AlphaFold has now been used by over 2.5 million researchers. Third, turning to products and platforms.

We offer products with a half a billion users now use Gemini models. Android and Pixel are two examples of how we are putting the best AI in people's hands, making it super easy to use AI for a wide range of tasks.

just by using their camera, voice, or taking a screenshot. We are upgrading Google Assistant on mobile devices to Gemini, and later this year, we'll upgrade tablets, cars, and devices that connect to your phone, such as headphones and watches. The Pixel 9a launched to very strong reviews, providing the best of Google's AI offerings, like Gemini Live, and AI-powered camera features. And Gemini Live camera and screen sharing is now rolling out to all Android devices, including

AI is one of the most revolutionary technologies for enabling and expanding our information mission. And for search, we see it growing the number and types of questions we can answer. We are already seeing this with AI overviews, which now has more than 1.5 billion users every month.

After we launched AI overviews in the US, we continue to see that usage growth is increasing as people learn that search is more useful for more of their queries. So we are leaning in heavily here, continuing to roll the feature out in new countries, to more users, and to more queries. Building on the positive feedback for AI overviews, in March, we released AI mode, an experiment in labs.

AI overviews can do with more advanced reasoning, thinking, and multimodal capabilities to help with questions that need further exploration and comparisons. On average, AI mode queries are twice as long as traditional search queries. We're getting really positive feedback from early users about its design, fast response time, and ability to understand complex, nuanced questions.

"See significant growth in multimodal queries. Circle to Search is now available on more than 250 million devices, with usage increasing nearly 40% this quarter. And monthly visual search queries are up 100% year over year."

Lens have increased by 5 billion since October. Moving on to cloud. At Cloud Next, we announced major innovations and over 500 companies shared the business results they are achieving.

We provide leading cost, performance, and reliability for AI training and inference. This enables us to deliver the best value for AI leaders, like AnyScale and Contextual AI, as well as global brands like Verizon.

Sensitive data and regulatory requirements. Google Distributed Cloud and our sovereign AI make Gemini available on-premises.

And YouTube now has over 1 billion monthly active podcast users. YouTube Music and Premium reached over 125 million subscribers.

We recently announced Washington, D.C. as a future ride-hailing city, going live in 2026, alongside Miami. Waymo continues progressing on two important capabilities for riders, airport access and freeway driving. Thanks to all of our employees for their work this quarter. It was a great start to the year, and Q2 will be even more exciting. With that, Philip, over to you. Thanks, Sundar, and hello, everyone.

performance for the quarter and then frame the rest of my remarks around the progress we're delivering across search, ads, YouTube and partnerships. Google services revenues were $77 billion for the quarter, up 10% year-on-year, driven by strong growth in search and YouTube, partially offset by year-on-year decline in network revenues. To add some further color to the performance, the 10% increase in search and other revenues was led by financial services,

to strengthen insurance, followed by retail. YouTube saw similar performance across verticals. Its 10% growth in advertising revenues was driven by direct response, followed by brand. So, let's start with search, where we've seen robust growth in revenues. All around the world, over 2 billion people use search every day to find information, compare products, or shop. And there are more than 5 trillion searches on Google annually.

Efforts to help more people ask entirely new questions, bringing more opportunities for businesses to connect with consumers, and, as we've mentioned before, with the launch of AI overviews, the volume of commercial queries has increased.

Our largest expansion to date for AI overviews, both in terms of launching to new users and providing responses for more questions. The feature is now available in more than 15 languages across 140 countries.

"Overall, we continue to see monetization at approximately the same rate, which gives us a strong base on which we can innovate even more. Turning to visual queries. On the last earnings call, I mentioned the successful

where shoppers use their camera or images to quickly find information in ways they couldn't before. In Q1, the number of people shopping on Lens grew over 10%, and the majority of Lens queries are incremental.

Significant growth we're also seeing with Circle to Search, as multi-modality continues to drive queries across search. Moving to ads, more businesses, big and small, are adopting AI-powered campaigns.

"across our ads business is driving results for our customers and for our business. Throughout 2024, we launched several features that leverage LLMs to enhance advertiser value, and we're seeing this work pay off. The combination of the

Now allows us to match ads to more relevant search queries. And this helps advertisers reach customers in searches where we would not previously have shown their ads. Focusing on our customers, we continue to solve

points and find opportunities to help them create, distribute and measure more performant ads, infusing AI at every step of the marketing process. On audience insights, we released new asset audience recommendations

On **Audience Insights**, businesses can now see the themes that resonate most with their top audiences. On **Creatives**, advertisers can now generate a broad variety of lifestyle imagery, customized to their business, to better engage their customers.

"Plus PMAX, Demand Gen, Display, and App campaigns. Additionally, in PMAX, advertisers can automatically source images from their landing pages and crop them, increasing the variety of their assets."

Advertisers continue to see how AI-powered campaigns help them find new customers. In Demand Gen, advertisers can more precisely manage ad placements across YouTube, Gmail, Discover, and Google Display Network globally, and understand which assets work best at a channel level. Thanks to dozens of AI-powered improvements launched in 2024,

Demand Gen now see an average 26% year-on-year increase in conversions per dollar spent for goals like purchases and leads. And when using Demand Gen with product feed, on average, they see more than double the conversion

As an example, Royal Canin combined Demand Gen and PMAX campaigns to find more customers for its cat and dog food products. The integration resulted in a 2.7x higher conversion rate, a 70% lower cost per acquisition for purchases, and increased the value per user by 8%. Turning to YouTube, where we saw strong growth in revenues across ads and subscriptions. This week, we're celebrating YouTube's 20th anniversary.

Our biggest creators

Fandom and viewer engagement around large cultural moments on YouTube that brands can't find anywhere else. During March Madness, brands align not only with clips and highlights from the game, but also with the creators who drive basketball culture, like Jesser and The Ringer's J.Kyle Mann.

The growth of our reservation-based ads business more than doubled year over year. Brands and creators continue to use the opportunities that collaborations and partnerships offer. Toyota worked with Zach King.

The creator takeover and accompanying creator ad lifted Toyota's brand awareness by 25% compared to a control group.

We continue to be pleased with the progress we're making globally in shorts monetization relative to in-stream viewing, and are particularly encouraged by the trend in the US. As always, I'll wrap up with the strong momentum we're seeing in partnerships.

For instance, Roblox is partnering with Google Ad Manager to bring immersive ads to gamers. Gen Z gamers are Roblox's biggest users, and thanks to our partnership,

able to reach this audience with ads that blend seamlessly into the gaming experience. We also launched a YouTube Shorts effect to help people release iconic Roblox heads and inspire fans to create content at scale.

I'd like to thank Googlers everywhere for their contributions and commitment to our success and to our customers and partners for their continued trust. Anand, over to you. Thank you, Philip. My comments will focus

Comparisons for the first quarter, unless they state otherwise. I will start with results at the alphabet level, and we'll then cover our segment results. I'll end with some commentary on our outlook for the second quarter.

Total cost of revenue was $36.4 billion, up 8%. Tech was $13.7 billion, up 6%. We continue to see a revenue mix shift with Google search growth at double-digit levels, while network revenues, which have much higher tech rate, declined.

Revenue was $22.6 billion, up 9%, with the increase primarily driven by content acquisition costs.

primarily reflecting a decline in compensation expenses.

Other income and expenses was $11.2 billion, primarily due to unrealized gain on our non-marketable equity securities related to our investment in a private company, which we noted in our 10K as a subsequent event. Net income increased 46% to $34.5 billion, and earnings per share increased 49% to $2.81.

Cash flow of $19 billion in the first quarter and $74.9 billion for the trailing 12 months. We ended the quarter with $95 billion in cash and marketable securities.

Results: Google Services revenues increased 10% to $77.3 billion, reflecting strength in Google Search and YouTube advertising as well as subscription. Google Search and other advertising

The robust performance of Search was once again broad-based across verticals, led by financial services, primarily due to strength in insurance, followed by retail. YouTube advertising revenues increased 10% to $8.9 billion, driven by direct response advertising, followed by brand.

"Revenue of $7.3 billion, we're down 2%."

The

in the form of $15.1 billion in share repurchases and $2.4 billion in dividend payments. As we announced today, our Board of Directors declared a 5% increase in our quarterly dividend

and use $70 billion share repurchase authorization. Turning to our outlook, I would like to provide some commentary on several factors that will impact our business performance in the second quarter and the remainder of 2025.

For revenue, I'll highlight a couple of items that we mentioned last quarter that will have an impact on second quarter and 2025 revenue. First, in Google Services, advertising revenue in 2025

By leaping the strength we experience in the financial service vertical.

To invest approximately $75 billion in capex this year. The expected capex investment level may fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to the impact of changes in the timing of deliveries and construction.

In terms of expenses, first, as I mentioned on our previous earnings call, the significant increase in our investments in CapEx over the past few years will continue to put pressure on the P&L, primarily in the form of higher depreciation. In the first quarter, we saw 31% year-on-year growth in depreciation.

In technical infrastructure,

Place in service.

Given the increase in CapEx investments over the past few years, we expect the growth rate in depreciation to accelerate throughout 2025. Second, as we've previously said, we expect some headcount growth in 2025 in key investment areas. As we've disclosed previously, due to a shift in the timing of our annual employee stock-based compensation award beginning in 2023, our first quarter stock-based comp expenses is relatively lower compared to the remaining quarters.

that enables us to create innovative new products and services for users, businesses and partners around the world. We have a strong track record of incubating and then building these offerings into new, profitable businesses for Alphabet. As we announced last quarter, YouTube and Cloud exited 2024 at a combined annual run rate of $110 billion. And as you heard from Sundar earlier,

continuing to progress in building on its impressive technological achievements to scale rapidly and develop a sustainable business model. Thank you. Sundar Pichai and I will now take your questions. Thank you.

To ask a question.

I'll need to press

goals or regions or categories that could be showing any signs of weakness quarter to date. We should think through any other changes from typical seasonality in 2Q25 versus prior quarters.

Philip, I think I heard you mention that the volume of commercial queries has increased. Maybe can you just walk us through which of the products are driving that increase in commercial queries? And as you sort of think about the pipeline of search products,

that you're particularly excited about to kind of continue to drive further commercial query growth throughout 25, 26. Thanks. So let me take the first one as well. Um, we saw broad-based strength across ad verticals, uh, in Q1 and, uh, we saw it, uh, give you a bit of vertical color here. Search was led again by finance, uh, due primarily

to ongoing strength in the insurance, retail, healthcare, and travel were actually also sizable contributors here to growth. Um, with regard to Q2, we're only a few weeks in, so it's really too early, uh,

I mean, we're obviously not immune to the macro environment, but we wouldn't want to speculate about potential impacts beyond noting that the changes to the de minimis exemption will obviously cause a slight headwind to our ads.

25% primarily from APEC-based retailers. And maybe to zoom out, I would say we have a lot of experience in managing through uncertain times, and we focus on helping our customers by providing

changing consumer behavior that is relevant to their business. Examples are auction dynamics, query trend insights on topics like replacement purchases, and so on. So we have a lot of experience in this area. On the commercial query side,

Reviews continue to drive higher satisfaction and search usage, and as I noticed, Q1 was really our largest expansion to date for AI overviews, both in terms of launching to new users and providing responses for more questions.

Core already of the answer, AI overview sits at the center of your question here. And when it comes to other products, look, I don't want to speculate on this, but we're happy with what we're seeing here on AI overviews and I

Uh, we can expand this to more products over time. Thank you. Your next question is from Doug Anmuth from JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Um, Phil, maybe just to go back to AI overviews for a moment. Um, can you just tell us how we should think about the one and a half

AI overviews users just in terms of breadth of rollout, and I know you're saying monetization at approximately the same rate, but what does that mean in terms of click-through rates and conversion? And then, Anant, just curious if there have been any changes to Google's approach to durably re-engineering the cost base.

And if macro weakens and we see more of a slowdown, would you expect to find additional opportunities to cut back more on costs? Thank you. Yeah, look, on the ads of in AI overviews,

Late last year, actually, we launched them within the AI overviews on mobile in the US, and this builds on our previous rollout of ads above and below. So this was a change we have. But as I talked about it before, for AI overviews,

The monetization at approximately the same rate, which gives us a strong base on which we can innovate even more. So I'm very happy with this. I don't think this is the moment to go into the details of click-through rates and conversion and so on. But overall, we're happy.

And to your question on our approach to productivity and efficiency, it hasn't really changed. I've mentioned my approach and our approach as a company on, uh, at the end of 2024.

Focus on driving efficiency and productivity throughout the organization, both in our operating expenses and in our CapEx. I've mentioned some of these on my, during my prepared remarks. Uh, but certainly this helps us as we think about the investments we need to make in innovation to drive long-term sustainable growth profile for the company.

purpose some of these efficiencies into these investments, as well as, as you think about the increase in CapEx we've seen in the past several years and what we're investing this year, this will put additional pressure on the income statement in the form of depreciation, so we're working hard to try and offset some of the headwinds, as well as within the CapEx investments themselves.

Billion dollars. We're looking at how do we make sure every dollar is used efficiently. We have a highly rigorous process to determine the demand behind it and then the allocation of the the compute associated with our technical infrastructure investments, ensuring that we're utilizing that appropriately and that we're highly efficient with everything we're doing.

Of the announcement,

changes

Continuing to drive differentiation for Gemini as a platform through the lens of usage, utility, or putting product innovation at the forefront of driving consumer habits. And then the second one, maybe for a nod, you know, it.

Thanks, Eric. You know, obviously, it's an exciting moment.

front. I think the foundation for everything is obviously the frontier model progress we are seeing, and particularly with 2.5 Pro and Flash, I think we're well positioned. We are seeing tremendous reception from developers, enterprises, and consumers, too. And

delivering consumer AI experiences across our product portfolio, including, you know, the primary way people experience it is obviously in search with AI overviews and

SOTA and that's been well received in Canvas, we've had a lot of traction as well. And so we are definitely investing more. We have recently organized ourselves better to capitalize on this momentum and I'm excited about our roadmap there.

investments this year and overall, should there be any macroeconomics changes. You know, as I said, we're still planning to invest approximately $75 billion in CapEx this year. We do see a tremendous opportunity

across the organization, whether it's to support Google services, Google Cloud and Google DeepMind. Recall, I've stated on the Q4 call that we exited the year in cloud specifically with more customer demand.

And that was the case this quarter as well. So we want to make sure we ramp up to support customer needs and customer demands. Having said that, we're investing in long-term and we're investing in

Essence of our business.

And we want to do it in a responsible fashion. So you've seen us over the past couple of years, and we're continuing to do this, and you're seeing this in our results, drive efficiency and productivity throughout the business. And, you know, we've announced things such as consolidation of teams, which helps not just with cost, but with velocity and speed. We're able to get things to market faster. So that's one of the areas we're focused on. You heard from Sundar the last couple of calls on just the rapid pace of innovation we're bringing to the marketplace.

What's happening outside the organization as well as inside, but invest appropriately to drive both the short-term growth as well as the long-term growth. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question comes from Ross Sandler from Barclays. Your line is now open.

Thanks. One for Sundar, one for Philip. Sundar, it was disclosed this week in the trial that's going on that Gemini has 35 million DAUs. And just curious, that number obviously trails ChatGPT by a pretty wide margin. Could you talk about the strategy to get that DAU figure much higher that you guys are deploying? And then, Philip.

Do you hear what you're seeing on the brand advertising side at YouTube in 1Q and into early 2Q? Are brands holding up relatively well, like direct response, or are they starting to react to some of these macro jitters that we're all experiencing? Any thoughts there? Thank you very much.

I think I touched upon this to Eric's question as well, but, you know, we are definitely, I think, you know, there's been a lot of momentum in terms of product features we've been introducing and, you know, we are.

reception, including increased adoption and usage based on those features. So, I think

By the way, also direct response had a very solid growth in Q1. Brand advertisers really enjoyed cultural moments we had, like Coachella, for example, or March Madness. We had strong contributions.

finance and retail verticals in Q1, on the side as well. The operating metrics for YouTube were strong in Q1. Watch time growth remains robust, particularly in key monetization opportunity areas, such as short

It's also, by the way, nice to see the strong position of our creators, who obviously benefit from the brand piece, which gives us a lot of confidence when we look at it more closely. And on the Q2 side,

Thank you. Your next question is from Mark. Your line is now open. Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Sundar, appreciate the color on Gemini deployment across kind of the 15 products with with half a billion users or more.

Here, more about where you're seeing the most usage and deployment of Gen AI internally at Google, uh, perhaps whether the capabilities, are they in a place today in terms of either supplementing or augmenting the workforce? Uh, and then just to build on that earlier AI mode type questions, appreciate AI mode has, you know, 2x longer queries than traditional search.

Look, on internally, I mean, this has been, you know, extraordinary amount of focus and excitement, both because I think, you know, we are, you know, the early.

transformative in nature, and I think this still feels like early days and long ways to go. Obviously, I had mentioned a few months ago, you know, in terms of how we are using AI for coding. We are continuing to make a lot of progress there in terms of, you know, people using coding suggestions. I think the last time I had said the number was like 25% of code that's checked in, uh, involves people accepting.

Solutions, that number is well over 30% now. But more importantly, we have deployed more deeper flows, and particularly with the newer models, I think, you know, we are working on early agentic workflows and

Can get those coding

Be much deeper.

It's been one of our most positive launches and, but, you know, it's been clear people have wanted even more of it. And so, uh, you know, with AI mode, we are bringing the, our state of the art

into search and, you know, I mentioned people typing in longer queries. There's a lot more complex, nuanced questions. People are following through more.

Thank you. Your next question is from Mark Mahaney from Evercore. Your line is now open. Okay, thanks. One for Anand and one for Sundar. Anand, getting back to a question I think that Doug was asking earlier on, you just put up, you know, record high or multi-year record high margins for both Google services and for Google Cloud. You talked

operation expenses accelerating rapidly, you know, throughout the year because of all the investments you've you've already, uh, you know, you'd you'd warned people about. Um, do you, uh, back in the September quarter, you seemed relatively confident that you had enough leverage

offset, you know, kind of rising infrastructure costs. Is that still your, you know, six months later, is that still your view that you've got enough levers that even with the rising infrastructure costs, you can, there's enough in there to kind of counterbalance that. And then just briefly on Waymo, the, the, the, continues to rise aggressively, the numbers, Sundar. The long-term,

For Waymo, is there a reason to make a decision on that soon, or have you already made a decision on whether this is a long-term licensing model, or you really want to run this as a standalone ride-sharing, delivery, autonomous vehicle business?

sustainability and what levers do we have and do we still have levers to pull? First, I think every organization can always push a little further. I don't view productivity goals or efficiency as an episodic, kind of project-based effort, but rather a continuous effort that when you get to a certain place, you push a little further. Having said that,

We have significant investments we're making across the organization, and we have been making them for the past several quarters. And we've been able to do it because we were able to find efficiency to fund those investments across the organization.

So, while we're trying to offset as much of the headwind associated with

And kind of an AI first Google across several of our functions to help us manage a larger scope of work using our AI, AI agents and AI tools. So they're mentioned we did deliver.

In preparation for the earnings call, we're leveraging across several functions. So there are opportunities, but there are also great opportunities for investment, and we want to make sure that we make room for to make these investments to drive long-term growth and ensure we have a very resilient long-term growth profile for the company. Uh, and Mark, thanks. I think, I think this is probably the first question.

Thanks call on Waymo. So thank you. And I think it's a sign of its progress. Look, you know, the thing that excites me is I think we've been laser focused and will continue to be on building the world's best driver. And I think, I think, I think doing that well, uh, you know, really gives you a variety of, uh, optionality in business models across geographies, etc. It'll also require a successful ecosystem of partners.

You know, we can't possibly do it all ourselves.

You have a number of AI-powered search interfaces, uh, including three most prominently, AI overviews, AI mode, and Gemini. In the future, should we think of these as distinct experiences?

Will be long-lasting or more experimental now, and Google will eventually focus on one approach going forward? And the second one is more on the financial side. You continue to experience very healthy gross margin expansion. We see the tack, sure, but you also talked about the offsetting depreciation expense. Can you talk about beyond those two buckets, where you're seeing the

on the COGS line and driving that gross margin expansion, and maybe even how we should be thinking about that going forward. Thank you. Okay, now, maybe on AI-powered search and

See my experiences.

"Can Gemini."

which will make sense in the context of AI overviews. So I think, I think will flow through to our user base.

And I've mentioned this in the prepared remarks, you've seen improvement in tech that's really driven by the change in revenue mix, with a continued search growth.

Revenue declines.

It has a much higher

So that mix is helping us from a gross margin perspective. So think about that as well. Now, we do have depreciation for technical infrastructure hits in two places, primarily in two places in the income statement. One is in other costs of sales and the rest is in R&D. So it is in that line item that's impacting costs of sales. Now, we've had some efficiencies there and I did mention the improvement in our overall cost of

In the coming quarters, recall we have, we said approximately $75 billion in CapEx, which is up from 55 or just over 50 billion last year. So there is, there's expected to be quite a significant increase in depreciation. Thank you. And our last question comes from Ron Josie from Citi. Your line is now open.

taking the question. Philip, I wanted to touch a little bit more on your comments around direct response and YouTube. I think it's been improving and been a driver over the past couple of quarters. I'd love to hear more just about what's driving that. Is that the demand gen and integration with PMAX or are users perhaps more

Yeah, I think there's a lot of different factors. Mostly, we continue to help our customers really using our AI-powered tools.

To drive performance, that's a very big one. As I mentioned before, we're also happy with the progress we're seeing on shorts and closing the monetization gap here to

which is actually really nice to see, especially in the US, so we're very happy with that.

And that concludes our question and answer session for today. I would like to turn the conference back over to Jim Freeland for any further remarks. Thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again.

2025 call. Thank you and have a good evening. Thank you, everyone. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.
